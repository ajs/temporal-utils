    Following in the steps of other open source projects that
    eventually take over the world, here is the partial list
    of people who have contributed to Temporal-Utils.
    It is sorted by name and formatted to allow easy
    grepping and beautification by scripts.
    The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W),
    description (D), subversion username (U) and snail-mail
    address (S).

        Thanks,

        The Temporal Utils Team
        PS: Yes, this looks remarkably like the Linux CREDITS format
