Temporal Utils
----------------

This project is intended to be a collection of libraries which
enhance the Temporal classes from Perl 6: Date and DateTime.

The first such library is DateTime::Utils, which formerly lived
in the Rakudo tree as DateTime::strftime.

It offers some useful exported subroutines to make working with DateTime
objects much easier.

Use 'ufo' to generate the Makefile for this project.
See http://github.com/masak/ufo for more details.
